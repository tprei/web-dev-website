    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      At the beginning, the native indigenous were the only source for brazilian music, whereas Portugal was the biggest contributor, in its majority instrumental. On the other side, Africa was mostly responsible for linking music and dance culture, being a big influence on popular and folklore music in the long term.

    <p>
      In the 18th century, there was a bigger cultural exchange with other European nations, making music in Brazil more diverse, with aspects that originated from Italy (Opera), France, Spain and Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the 19th century, brazilian music took a more traditional turn and many authentic genres were consolidated, such as samba and forró.

      During the 60s and 70s, Brazil was going through a military dictatorship, which led to many artists making music as a form of protesting. In the 80s, Brazil was free from that regimé but many problems persisted and Rock music was very famous for  pointing them out. 
      Sertanejo was also beginning to be adopted by the big cities.
