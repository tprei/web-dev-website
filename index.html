    <p>
      Music is one of the main forms of art and culture spread throughout Brazil.
      As it is known, the mixture of culture and elements is a big part of the country and music was no different.
      It was introduced and developed from many different sources, such as those from the native indigenous people who
      were the first to live there, but also from other nations that were part of brazilian history: colonizers from
      Europe (specifically Portugal and Spain) and slaves from Africa.

      North to South.
      One car hear a very explicit difference in contemporary trending songs in Rio de Janeiro (in the southeast) and
      Pernambuco (in the northeast).
