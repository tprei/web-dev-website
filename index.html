        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Music is one of the main forms of art and culture spread throughout Brazil.
          As it is known, the mixture of culture and elements is a big part of the country and music was no different.
          It was introduced and developed from many different sources, such as those from the native indigenous people who
          were the first to live there, but also from other nations that were part of brazilian history: colonizers from
          Europe (specifically Portugal and Spain) and slaves from Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also interesting that music is very regional in Brazil, given how large and diverse in culture it is from
          North to South.
          One car hear a very explicit difference in contemporary trending songs in Rio de Janeiro (in the southeast) and
          Pernambuco (in the northeast).
